If you are new to [Go](https://golang.org/) or, like me, you started some time ago but for some reason you missed fundamentals, this post could be useful to answer why things work certain way. I recently attended [Go Ultimate course](https://www.ardanlabs.com/ultimate-go) imparted by [Bill Kennedy](https://twitter.com/goinggodotnet) so I will explain here what did I learn.

I have been coding in Go for the last 2 years now, so I could be wrong. I would be really happy if you could ping me in case you consider there is a mistake.

## What is Go?

Go is a statically typed, compiled, data oriented programming language that doesn't use a virtual machine, such as is provided by the Java runtime. Go programs are compiled ahead of time to native machine code. It works on top of the hardware and it was built getting best of other languages.

The simplicity of language often helps ourselves or other developers in the future to make more efficient code. So ***don't make code easy to do, make it easy to understand.***

## Low level

To understand how to write better code, it is important to know that the sofware could be affected by:
1. External latency (milliseconds).
2. Internal latency (garbage collection, sync and orchestration) (reducing it can improve +20%, microseconds)
As we saw on what its a middleware and where it is, it is a piece of code between actions and reducers.
3. Algorith efficiency.

Processors: On intel machines with **Hiperthread** (Intelâ€™s name for simultaneous multithreading), that means it doubles the number of processors availables (i.e. dual-core hyper-threaded CPU have 4 processors, quad-core non-HT CPU has 4 processors. Quad core option is the better choice, thought, because it has more physical processing hardware).
We could always check the number of processors available with `runtime.NumCPU()`
Keep in mind the [Playground](https://play.golang.org/) is a single processor machine.

![Stack memory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marioarranzr/dev.to/master/blog-posts/go-fundamentals/assets/stack.png)

When an application starts and calls `main()`, every line of code could:
1. Allocate memory
2. Read memory
3. Write memory

Bugs are (almost) always in writting memory. Every problem we solve is data transformation issue.

# Value semantics vs pointer semantics:

In Go there are many ways to initialise a variable:

```go
var count int // use this way to initialise a variable, for 0-value
count := 10   // use this way for non 0-value
count := 0    // NOT a good practise

u := user{
    age: 10,
}
u := &user{
    age: 10,
}
```
