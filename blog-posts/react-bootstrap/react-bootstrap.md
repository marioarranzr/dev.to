## Installing React

Let's install and use the [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) tool to initialise a react app with the main configuration:
```bash
npm install -g create-react-app 
# We might need adding sudo at the begining
```

Create the directory we want to start working with and go into it:
```
mkdir react-bootstrap
cd react-bootstrap
```

Create the scaffolding in directory:
```
create-react-app .
```

At this point we should have a sample react app, so we can run it locally:
```
yarn start
```

## Adding some styles

Bootstrap is the most popular CSS Framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites and there is a react version that we can install:

```
yarn add react-bootstrap bootstrap
```

Finally we need to set it in `src/index.js` simply adding an extra import: 

```js
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';
```

Now, when loading the website (run `yarn start` in case you stopped it), we will see some diferent colors caused by bootstrap.

## Try it out

After configuring out react app to use bootstrap, the next thing we can do is taking advantage of its simplicity for creating a beautiful UI without being a CSS expert.

But in orther to do that, we need fetching some data to show.

As we saw in `src/index.js`
```js
ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

the website is default configured to load the `App` component. So, in this case, that is going the component to modify.

So far, this `App.js` is using a *functional component*, a component which doesnâ€™t have its own state or needs to access a lifecycle hook

```js
function App() {
  return (
      // ...
  )
}
```

Showing some data in the UI means we need to have it before loading the page. An advantage of using *React components* over *functional components* is we can override *lifecycle methods*. So the first change is tyransforming the *functional component* into a *React component*

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
// ...

class App extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
            // ...
        )
    }
}
```

At this point we can fetch the data, and to do it before page loads completely we will override `componentDidMount()`

```js
class App extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    fetch('http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users')
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then((data) => {
      this.setState({ contacts: data })
      console.log(this.state.contacts)
    })
    .catch(console.log)
  }
    
  render() {
    return (
      // ...
    )
  }
}
```

Thanks to `console.log()` when we reload the website and having the developer tools opened we can see the result

Last but not least, we structure the data into [bootstrap cards](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.com/components/cards/#cards)

```js
import React, { Component, Fragment } from 'react';
import {Card, Button} from 'react-bootstrap'

class App extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    // ...
  }
    
  render() {
    return (
      <Fragment>
        <CardGroup>
          {this.state.contacts.map((contact, idx) => (
            <Card key={idx}>
              <Card.Body>
                <Card.Title>{ contact.name }</Card.Title>
                <Card.Text>
                  { contact.email }
                </Card.Text>
                <Button variant="warning" size="sm" > 
                  <a href={ 'https://' + contact.website } target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">{contact.website}</a>
                </Button>
              </Card.Body>
            </Card>
          ))}
        </CardGroup>
      </Fragment>
    )
  }
}
```
